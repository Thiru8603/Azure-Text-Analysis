Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive guide on using Azure Text Analytics for various text analysis tasks. It covers language detection, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, and entity recognition, utilizing Azure's powerful cognitive services.

Tasks
Task 1: Detecting Language
Setup: Configure the cognitive services by obtaining endpoints and keys from the Azure site. Set up the text analytics client and Azure key credential.
Execution: Add text to the documents, perform language detection, and obtain the language name, code, and confidence score.
Task 2: Sentiment Analysis
Overview: Sentiment analysis determines the emotional tone of a text, categorizing it as neutral, positive, or negative. Techniques are used to analyze overall and specific sentiments.
Verification: Check how well the sentiment analysis identifies sentiments and ensure the results align with the expected outcomes.
Task 3: Key Phrase Extraction
Overview: Extract key phrases from unstructured text using Azure AI Language's machine learning models. This capability helps in identifying primary topics or themes quickly.
Task 4: Entity Recognition
Overview: Use Azure AI's Video Indexer AI tool for named entity extraction to gather information about places, people, and brands from audio and image data.
Reflection
